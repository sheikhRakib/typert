**Description:** Typert is a typing game designed to improve your typing skills. It challenges you to type random words before they reach the end of the screen. Sharpen your typing speed and accuracy while having fun with Typert.

> Typert was originally created as my undergraduate course project. This version of the game includes modified code to improve efficiency and update some of its logic.
